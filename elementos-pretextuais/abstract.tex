In this project I describe the development of a binary classifier using a support vector machine algorithm known as Kernel - Adatron Algorithm for Sequential and parallel versions. The parallel version runs on GPU using it's SIMD model (Single Instruction Multiple Data ). I latter analyze the different performance in time and accuracy between the various versions and changing the algorithm's parameters.
